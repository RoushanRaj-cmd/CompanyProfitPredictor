# ðŸ“ˆ Company Profit Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict company profits using linear regression, achieving **RÂ² = 0.9958** with a clean and interpretable model â€” **without overfitting**.

- `CompanyProfitPrediction.ipynb` â€” Jupyter Notebook with all steps
- `1000_Companies.csv` â€” Dataset used
- `README.md` â€” Youâ€™re here!

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- âœ… Outlier removal using **IQR method**
- âœ… Feature encoding without `drop_first`
- âœ… Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- âœ… Comparison of **Linear**, **Ridge**, and **Lasso** regression
- âœ… Visualization and residual analysis
- âœ… Regularization to confirm model robustness
- âœ… Verified against overfitting using:
  - Train/Test RÂ² scores
  - Residual plots
  - Lasso feature elimination

## ðŸ§  Inspiration

Inspired by a curiosity: *Can simple regression models still work this well if the data is clean and the pipeline is strong?*  
The answer: **Yes.** âœ…
